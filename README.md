model-ts-knex
=====

A merely mildly magical model maker for Knex in Typescript.

Goals:

- Minimal but descriptive usage.
- Includes utility to generate migrations after changing your models.
- Minimal abstraction: model methods are just Knex query factories.
- Generate JSONSchemas for new and existing record shapes.
- Simple transaction support.
- Decent out-of-the-box TS typing for all basic queries.
- Not an ORM.  This isn't Bookshelf.  (I think...)

> TK examples and usage and stuff.
